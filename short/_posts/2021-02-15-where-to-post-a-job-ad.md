title: Where to post an engineering job ad?
---

It sounds like a fully solved problem. Good luck if you need remote employees. 
All begins with a multitude of choice across the globe. 
I found this [helpful list online](the 51 best job boards for software engineers):

Stack Overflow (random posters say it starts at around 5k per year. Yikes!),
Dice,
Crunchboard,
GitHub,
Mashable,
Icrunchdata,
ITJobPro,
Authentic Jobs,
WeWorkRemotely,
Indeed Prime,
F6S, Smashing Jobs, LinkedIn, plust more!

Addition of a "remote" option to the majority of boards feels unnatural and unfinished, more like an afterthought.
Remote might mean totally remote but then time zone matters, or remote but within a country.
Then you look into something like Indeed, and they want you to provide a city. What?
