title: Trying to publish an iOS app
---

Apple has a problem, and it is a big one. 
Current offering that includes devices, xcode, swift and swiftui is not great.
And it needs to be great for people to be able to write better apps/games/you-name-it.
Google got it and their Android ecosystem is easier to work with, easier to handle. 
On Android Java problems were alleviated with Kotlin, Android Studio is based on 
IntelliJ which is fast and responsive, and build tooling is easy to use. This is 
not the case on Apple side. Xcode is slowish, constantly shows ghost errors, and feels 
out of date. Newer Swift language looks great, but the SwitfUI framework lacks 
important features where workarounds are necessary. Documentation is poor.
Publishing process is somewhat complicated. The best part about Apple is the fixed set
of hardware you need to work with.

The way I like to put it to myself is to ask, would I want my kids to go through 
this, to learn and do this?
