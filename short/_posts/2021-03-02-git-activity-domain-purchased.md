title: New side project GitActivity
---

I just purchased a new domain name, "gitactivity.com", to solve 
an old problem of not understanding what I'm working on anymore. 
Zillions of repositories (private and public), a bunch of commits, 
and then try and fill in your timesheets if you do that at the 
end of the week.

I hope it'll end up being a free service for everyone. Developers 
should sign in with Github and observe structured (or even graphed) 
commits among various repositories.
