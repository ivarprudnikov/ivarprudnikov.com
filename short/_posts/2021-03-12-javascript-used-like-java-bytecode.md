title: Javascript is used like Java bytecode

If you were using Javascript as your primary language for some time, 
you might wonder where it's heading. There was this thought in the morning, 
given all the circumstance. What if Javascript will become something like 
Java bytecode in the future, or maybe it already is? What I mean is that 
other intermediary forms that require compilation are replacing the vanilla 
language: Typescript, ASM.js, Coffeescript (not that popular anymore), 
ES7 and ES8 with Babel, Kotlin, Grooscript, etc. Then I draw a parallel 
between Javascript and Bytecode, and it kind of fits in a way. Java then 
becomes Typescript, ASM.js (C/C++) is like Kotlin, Coffeescript like 
Groovy, ES8 (and ES9, ES10) are like all newer Java versions.

Why this idea matters? For one, anyone could look into the evolution of 
Java and its ecosystem to make sure mistakes do not get repeated. 
Furthermore, if the above correlation is tangible, we could expect 
the fork of the current most popular Javascript Virtual Machine (browser) 
into something like Android. Keep in mind that Node.js is already a thing, 
just like Electron and React Native. What is more, Vanilla will most likely 
cease to be the primary target for the developers. Just like nobody writes 
Java bytecode by hand. Finally, the JVM ecosystem's task runners are pretty 
crucial and have evolved into a few most popular ones (Maven, Gradle, Ant). 
Given the last thought, Webpack, Parcel and similar will collapse into a 
few and will be a thing you need to understand to get a job.
