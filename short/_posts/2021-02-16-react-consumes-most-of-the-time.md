title: React consumes most of the time
---

React is a blessing and a curse at the same time.
The simplicity of it allows somewhat faster implementations of various features.
On the other hand, you end up spending most of the time writing jsx purely because of that.
Maybe less time should be spent on doing a new button, and instead, the focus could be switched to topics such as security? A latter suggestion might be a tough nut to crack
given that a new fancy website pulls 3 thousand dependencies these days ðŸ¤¯.
