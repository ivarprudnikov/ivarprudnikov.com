title: Just when you thought it was a tough day
---

A day starts like a ballistic missile. 
There is little you can do to change the course due to a variety of habits.
And then in those rare occasions it just blows up. To make matters worse the 
remaining parts of this missile fall on your house.

Amongst that fire I discovered that Google Assistant cannot be disabled on 
your kids' Android accounts (secondary to the parent ones). It's like we're 
in the old Microsoft days when apps get baked in. Furthermore, there is no 
real way to block explicit content. There you go kid, a semi-restricted 
account where assistant will show you some pictures that make your dad cry.
