Had a chance to speak in ["Cork|Sec" meetup](https://www.meetup.com/CorkSec/) here in Ireland, 
[the event](https://www.meetup.com/CorkSec/events/265337771/) was busy enough. People filled the area on the 
first floor in a pub called ["An Spailpin Fanach"](https://www.facebook.com/anspailpinfanac/).

I spoke about authentication in web products and the difficulties it brings each time you need to implement it.
That talk was structured into 4 main sections: how different public sector is, adding authentication, improving 
authentication and using third party authentication provider.
