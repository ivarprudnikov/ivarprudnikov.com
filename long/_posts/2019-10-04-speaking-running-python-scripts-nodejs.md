Broke the ice with my first meetup talk in ["Dublin Node.js Meetup"](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Node-js-Meetup/). [Event](https://www.meetup.com/Dublin-Node-js-Meetup/events/264888601/) took place in the heart of Dublin next to St Stephen's Green in the office space provided by [Intercom](https://www.intercom.com/). People from [Nearform](https://www.nearform.com/) were hosting the event.

Topic is quite basic but was connected with the story about the origins of such requirement - executing Python from NodeJS. I wrote about it a bit earlier:

- [Using Python scripts in Node.js server]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url long/2018-11-11-nodejs-server-running-python-scripts %})
- [Run Tensorflow scripts from Node.js server deployed on AWS as Docker container]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url long/2018-12-20-run-tensorflow-scripts-nodejs-server-deployed-aws-docker-container %})
