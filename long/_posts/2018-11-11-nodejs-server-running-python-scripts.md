A while back ago I was learning/playing with machine/deep learning but all that was only in _Python_, in a _Jupyter Notebook_. Latter allows writing and running and executing scripts in a browser window. Unfortunately I was not aware of any obvious way to easily reuse those scripts in a webapp. So I decided to write an example of how would it look like to be able to call _Python_ scripts from withing a running server application, hence this article.

There was [an attempt](https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/facial-keypoints) to use _Python_ alone for both the server and scripting, unfortunately it failed, most likely due to the fact that I am mostly _Javascript_ / _Java_ programmer these days. [Writing webapp](https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/facial-keypoints/tree/master/app) with _Flask_, which is one of the popular choices among _Python_ developers, was a tedious experience for me compared to development process with _Express_(_Node.js_) or _Spring Boot_(_Java_). I still managed to [wrap that half finished _attempt_ in _Docker_](https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/facial-keypoints/blob/master/Dockerfile) and deploy to _AWS_ though.

Another more elaborate and a bit more successful implementation of this idea using _Node.js_ can be found in _Github_ repository [ivarprudnikov/char-rnn-tensorflow](https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/char-rnn-tensorflow). It uses a _Python_ script which is an implementation of _Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)_ character generator written in _Tensorflow_ framework. I've written about it as well in another post ["Run Tensorflow scripts from Node.js server deployed on AWS as Docker container"]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url long/2018-12-20-run-tensorflow-scripts-nodejs-server-deployed-aws-docker-container %})

## Python script

For the purpose of my example I will use a simple _Python_ script which outputs messages to standard output along the way:

```python
#!/usr/bin/python
import sys, getopt, time

def main(argv):
    argument = ''
    usage = 'usage: script.py -f <sometext>'
    
    # parse incoming arguments
    try:
        opts, args = getopt.getopt(argv,"hf:",["foo="])
    except getopt.GetoptError:
        print(usage)
        sys.exit(2)
    for opt, arg in opts:
        if opt == '-h':
            print(usage)
            sys.exit()
        elif opt in ("-f", "--foo"):
            argument = arg

    # print output
    print("Start : %s" % time.ctime())
    time.sleep( 5 )
    print('Foo is')
    time.sleep( 5 )
    print(argument)
    print("End : %s" % time.ctime())

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main(sys.argv[1:])
```

Above script will not execute immediately which makes it necessary to hold on to the process and read from its output until it finishes. We do not want to use it sequentially in a webapp as this might takes quite long time to execute. This script accepts arguments as well:

- `$ python script.py -f sometext` - pass `sometext` as a value for option `foo`
- `$ python script.py --foo sometext` - similar as above
- `$ python script.py -h` - prints help text

## Node server

There are three main problems: 
- call Python script,
- pass script output to client and 
- render output in the client. 

Lets start with the former by creating simple _Node.js_ program, call it `server.js` and prepare to fill in the code.

### Run python script

One of the accessible commands provided in _Node.js_ API is [`child_process.spawn()`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/child_process.html#child_process_child_process_spawn_command_args_options).

> The child_process.spawn() method spawns a new process using the given command, with command line arguments in args.

So to run above Python script, provided it is called `script.py`, we could add following to out `server.js`:

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const {spawn} = require('child_process')

/**
 * Run python script, pass in `-u` to not buffer console output 
 * @return {ChildProcess}
 */
function runScript(){
  return spawn('python', [
    "-u", 
    path.join(__dirname, 'script.py'),
    "--foo", "some value for foo",
  ]);
}

const subprocess = runScript()

// print output of script
subprocess.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`data:${data}`);
});
subprocess.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
  console.log(`error:${data}`);
});
subprocess.on('close', () => {
  console.log("Closed");
});
```

In above example the script output is going to come in through `.on('data', callback)`. Also it was necessary to use `-u` flag when running the script to prevent Python from buffering output, otherwise `data` event would not get `print()` statements from script up until the end of execution.

To test if everything works just run it and check the Python script output is visible in the shell.

```bash
$ node server.js
Start : Tue Nov 13 18:57:53 2018
.
..
...
....
Foo is
some value for foo
....
...
..
.
End : Tue Nov 13 18:58:03 2018
``` 

### Render script output in HTTP response

If you are using _Express_ framework then sending back output would be as easy as _piping_ the output of child process (running script) to response of HTTP request:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()

// <...>

app.get('/run', function (req, res) {
  const subprocess = runScript()
  res.set('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
  subprocess.stdout.pipe(res)
  subprocess.stderr.pipe(res)
})

app.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running'))
```

Unfortunately _piping_ everything back to response requires client either to understand that response is chunked or to wait for execution of script to finish before rendering output. Latter is going to happen if you will be consuming endpoint with the likes of `jQuery`:

```javascript
jQuery.get("/run").done(function (data) {
  console.log(data) // rendered after all data was transferred
})
```

### Using WebSocket to render output

<div class="d-flex justify-content-center align-items-start my-4">
  <figure class="flex-fill text-center figure">
    <img class="img-fluid" alt="app file structure" src="/assets/node-python-websocket-webpage.png" />
    <figcaption class="figure-caption">
      WebSocket output in webpage
    </figcaption>
  </figure>
</div>

To send back script output in chunks, we could use _WebSockets_, this will require _Node.js_ server to accept incoming requests via this protocol and the client to be able to connect to it.

First lets install some dependencies:
```bash
$ npm i -S ws
```

Then expand our previous `server.js` to deal with new _WebSocket_ conections. First we ought to listen to new connections:

```javascript
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const http = require("http")
const WebSocket = require("ws")
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({server});

wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    ws.send(`You sent -> ${message}`);
  });
  ws.send('Connection with WebSocket server initialized');
});

server.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running'))
```

Client can now easily send messages to the server:

```javascript
var conn = {}
function openConnection() {
  if (conn.readyState === undefined || conn.readyState > 1) {
    conn = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/');
    conn.onopen = function () {
      console.log("Socket open")
    };
    conn.onmessage = function (event) {
      console.log(event.data)
    };
    conn.onclose = function (event) {
      console.log("Socket closed")
    };
  }
}
if (window.WebSocket === undefined) {
  console.log("Sockets not supported")
} else {
  openConnection();
}
```

The caveat here is that now in order to request the server to start executing the script it is easier to use same _WebSocket_ connection instead of _HTTP_ request. If we wanted to use _HTTP_ it would be necessary to know which _WebSocket_ connection to respond to in the server and for this some sort of session identification would need to be implemented.

For now lets just agree that when client sends message `"run"`, then server will understand it as a request to run a script.

After I lump it all together in one _Node.js_ script I get:

```javascript
const path = require('path')
const {spawn} = require('child_process')
const express = require('express')
const app = express()
const http = require("http")
const WebSocket = require("ws")
const server = http.createServer(app);
const wss = new WebSocket.Server({server});

function runScript() {
  return spawn('python', [
    "-u",
    path.join(__dirname, 'script.py'),
    "--foo", "some value for foo",
  ]);
}

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
  res.send(`<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
<body>
<button type="button" onclick="runWebsocket()">Run with websocket</button>
<pre id="outputWebsocket"></pre>

<script>
  var outputWebsocket = document.getElementById("outputWebsocket")
  function runWebsocket() {
    outputWebsocket.innerText = ""
    openConnection(function (connection) {
      connection.send("run")
    })
  }
  function appendWSText(text) {
    outputWebsocket.innerText += text
  }
  var conn = {}
  function openConnection(cb) {
    // uses global 'conn' object
    if (conn.readyState === undefined || conn.readyState > 1) {
      conn = new WebSocket('ws://' + window.location.host + '/');
      conn.onopen = function () {
        appendWSText("\\nSocket open")
        if(typeof cb === "function"){
          cb(conn)
        }
      };
      conn.onmessage = function (event) {
        appendWSText(event.data)
      };
      conn.onclose = function (event) {
        appendWSText("\\nSocket closed")
      };
    } else if(typeof cb === "function"){
      cb(conn)
    }
  }
  if (window.WebSocket === undefined) {
    appendWSText("\\nSockets not supported")
  } else {
    openConnection();
  }
</script>
</body>
</html>`)
})

function runScriptInWebsocket(id, ws) {
  const child = runScript("foobar")
  child.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
    ws.send(`${id}:${data}`);
  });
  child.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
    ws.send(`${id}:error:\n${data}`);
  });
  child.stderr.on('close', () => {
    ws.send(`${id}:done`);
  });
}

let id = 1
wss.on('connection', (ws) => {
  const thisId = id++;
  ws.on('message', (message) => {
    ws.send(`You sent -> ${message}`);
    if ("run" === message) {
      runScriptInWebsocket(thisId, ws)
    }
  });
  ws.send('Connection with WebSocket server initialized');
});

server.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running'))
```

Above will start a server and will render simple _HTML_ which will be able to deal with _WebSocket_.
