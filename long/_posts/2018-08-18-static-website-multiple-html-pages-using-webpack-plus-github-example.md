Most of the time I tend to client needs — integration, search functionality, complex business logic. But this time I needed a simple website for myself.

Writing `html` with a bit of `css` and `javascript` is not that hard, but making sure assets are not aggressively cached, styles are understood in older browsers and scripts using newer language features get _transpiled_ is another issue. It is possible to write additional [scripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_script) dealing with aforementioned issues, but those problems are already solved in developer community. There are bunch of task runners a developer could use: [_Grunt_](https://gruntjs.com/), [_Gulp_](https://gulpjs.com/), [_Browserify_](http://browserify.org/), [_Parcel_](https://parceljs.org/), [_Rollup_](https://rollupjs.org), [_Webpack_](https://webpack.js.org/) or even [_Ant_](https://ant.apache.org/) and [_Gradle_](https://gradle.org/).

**Here I’m not going to compare provided options** but rather use what I have experience with.

**Reference implementation (example) of what I talk about is in the following repository:**
[**ivarprudnikov/webpack-static-html-pages**](https://github.com/ivarprudnikov/webpack-static-html-pages)

**Note: Babel updated to `v7` on 2019-01-17.** You could check out reference implementation with `v6` by looking into `git` history.

## Requirements at hand

* Multiple `html` pages (no [SPA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application))
* Minify and cache bust `css` and `js` files in production
* Usage of [_NPM_](https://www.npmjs.com/) modules
* Development server

## Choosing task runner/bundler

I used to do *Grunt*, *Gulp*, *Browserify*, but lately switched to *Webpack* — preferred choice alongside [_React_](https://reactjs.org/) development. There was no hesitation in being consistent with what I use most often, so to fulfill above requirements I tried *Webpack*. Did not believe at first it will be possible or viable as usually it would be used for a single page app having just one `html` page.

## Development server

To start development of an app you could choose one of [Webpack’s starter kits](https://webpack.js.org/starter-kits/) provided by developers in the community, but when you have so many choices (not limited to above link) it is hard to make up your mind. It is necessary to know the API to allow oneself evaluating starter kit properly, or just try one by one. Because my goal was to make plain `html` pages without any use of *React* or *Vue.js* or *Angular* or else, I looked for lightest setup. There was one that caught my eye:
[**lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic**](https://github.com/lifenautjoe/webpack-starter-basic)

**Otherwise if you would start from scratch** you could make it lighter by writing config yourself.

```bash
$ mkdir -p MyProject/src && cd MyProject
$ npm init
$ npm i -D webpack webpack-cli webpack-dev-server html-webpack-plugin
$ touch src/index.html src/index.js
```

With above commands we start setting up our project. I used `npm init` to bootstrap `package.json` then `npm i -D` to install dependencies and touch to create first files. Next let’s put something in `index.html` but leave `index.js` empty:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My homepage</title>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta http-equiv="cache-control" content="no-cache"/>
  <meta http-equiv="pragma" content="no-cache"/>
  <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport"
        content="width=device-width,user-scalable=0,initial-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0">
</head>
  <h1 class="page-title">HOMEPAGE</h1>
</body>
</html>
```

Now to serve it we need some basic *Webpack* config `webpack.dev.js`:

```bash
$ touch webpack.dev.js
```

Above will create our config file. Paste following inside it:

```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {

  // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/#multi-page-application
  entry: {
    index: './src/index.js'
  },

  // https://webpack.js.org/configuration/dev-server/
  devServer: {
    port: 8080
  },

  // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/
  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/index.html',
      inject: true,
      chunks: ['index'],
      filename: 'index.html'
    })
  ]
};
```

At this moment you can start development server and inspect results in the browser `http://localhost:8080`:

```bash
./node_modules/webpack-dev-server/bin/webpack-dev-server.js --config webpack.dev.js --mode development
```

You will see previously created `index.html` with injected `index.js` in it. This is the magic of `HtmlWebpackPlugin` achieved by creating entry point and then referencing it in its plugin config with `inject: true` and `chunks: [‘index’]` .

**Pro tip:** to simplify above command just put it into `package.json` under scripts then you will be able to just `npm start` from command line:

```json
{
  "name": "myproject",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --mode development"
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC",
  "devDependencies": {
    "html-webpack-plugin": "^3.2.0",
    "webpack": "^4.28.4",
    "webpack-cli": "^3.2.1",
    "webpack-dev-server": "^3.1.14"
  }
}
```

## More HTML pages

Let’s add more basic `html` pages like `about.html` and `contacts.html`, next to current `index.html` **I will deal with CSS later**. Now update Webpack config to serve those pages:

```js
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {

  // ...

  plugins: [
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/index.html',
        inject: true,
        chunks: ['index'],
        filename: 'index.html'
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/about.html',
        inject: true,
        chunks: ['index'],
        filename: 'about.html'
    }),
    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
        template: './src/contacts.html',
        inject: true,
        chunks: ['index'],
        filename: 'contacts.html'
    })
  ]
};
```

Above we are reusing `index.js` file in every page with `chunks: [‘index’]` to change this just add new *Javascript* files `about.js` `contacts.js` then use those in `entry` configuration and reference it in `HtmlWebpackPlugin` configuration options:

```js
//...
entry: {
    index: './src/index.js',
    about: './src/about.js', 
    contacts: './src/contacts.js'
},
//...
plugins: [
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/about.html',
      inject: true,
      chunks: ['about'],
      filename: 'about.html'
  }),
  new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
      template: './src/contacts.html',
      inject: true,
      chunks: ['contacts'],
      filename: 'contacts.html'
  }),
  // ...
]
//...
```

**Pro tip**: develop naming convention for your `html` and `js` files and configure them all at once by loading them via [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) in `webpack.dev.js`.

## Adding CSS

This might seem counter intuitive but those *Javascript* files created previously will serve as a proxy to get to `css`. First get the [normalize.css](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) :

```bash
$ npm i -S normalize.css
```

Now _require_ it in _Javascript_ files previously created, add following import to top of the file:

```js
require('normalize.css/normalize.css');
```

**Above will fail if you start development server.** *Webpack* does not know yet what to do with that file. To fix it just a new rule in `webpack.dev.js` and [install specific modules](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader) that deal with `css`:

```bash
$ npm i -D css-loader style-loader
```

Then add the rule:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/
  module: {
    rules: [
      {
        test: /\.css$/,
        use: [
          "style-loader",
          "css-loader"
        ]
      }
    ]
  },
  // ...
}
```

Now after `npm start` you’ll see link to `css` stylesheet injected in the `head` element of an `html` file. To add more stylesheets just _require()_ them in _Javascript_ file.

**Pro tip:** use Sass instead of plain `css` by adding one more loader [https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/style-loader)

## Use latest Javascript language features

Make sure we have *Javascript* file with very new features, like **class** and **static** methods. Below example is our `index.js` and it should print `1234` in the console when page loads.

```js
require('normalize.css/normalize.css');

class Foo {
    constructor(){
        this.value = "foobar"
    }
    static instance() {
        return new Foo()
    }
    getValue() {
        return this.value
    }
}

console.log(Foo.instance().getValue())
```

To make above work among browsers it needs to be *transpiled/compiled/desugared* into simpler form of *Javascript*. And again to do that we need to install new modules that will help us:

```bash
$ npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env
```

Then define a new rule for *Javascript* files in `webpack.dev.js`:

```js
// ...
module: {
    rules: [
        {
            test: /\.js$/,
            exclude: /node_modules/,
            loader: 'babel-loader',
            options: {
                presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
            }
        },
        // ...
    ]
},
// ...
```

After restarting server and inspecting modified `index.js` file it will show simplified *Javascript* similar to:

```js
// ...
var Foo = function () {
    function Foo() {
      _classCallCheck(this, Foo);
      this.value = "foobar";
    }
  
    _createClass(Foo, [{
        key: "getValue",
        value: function getValue() {
            return this.value;
        }
    }], [{
        key: "instance",
        value: function instance() {
            return new Foo();
        }
    }]);
  
    return Foo;
}();

console.log(Foo.instance().getValue());
```

## Assembling production release

At this time we have a project which can be run locally, but in order for it to be deployed to remote server couple of things need to happen:

* minify `css`, `js` files, because bytes matter;
* add a hash to the names of minified files, this way we can configure server to serve those with appropriate cache headers with confidence that new versions will still be fetched by browser;
* make sure correct filenames are used in `html`;
* store generated files in a configured location;

It is possible to use existing `webpack.dev.js` and have conditionals inside that differentiate between *production* and *development* environments to execute tasks mentioned above, but then it gets a bit complicated and harder to read, for this reason new `webpack.prod.js` configuration file will be setup. But first lets get more dependencies to help us with minification, optimization:

```bash
npm i -D clean-webpack-plugin mini-css-extract-plugin optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin terser-webpack-plugin http-server
```

Now we can safely write configuration, looks similar to `webpack.dev.js`:

```js
const path = require('path');
const { CleanWebpackPlugin } = require('clean-webpack-plugin'); 
const HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');
const MiniCssExtractPlugin = require("mini-css-extract-plugin");
const OptimizeCssAssetsPlugin = require('optimize-css-assets-webpack-plugin');
const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin')
const buildPath = path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist');

module.exports = {

    // This option controls if and how source maps are generated.
    // https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/
    devtool: 'source-map',

    // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/entry-points/#multi-page-application
    entry: {
        index: './src/index.js',
        about: './src/about.js',
        contacts: './src/contacts.js'
    },

    // how to write the compiled files to disk
    // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/output/
    output: {
        filename: '[name].[hash:20].js',
        path: buildPath
    },

    // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/loaders/
    module: {
        rules: [
            {
                test: /\.js$/,
                exclude: /node_modules/,
                loader: 'babel-loader',
                options: {
                    presets: ['@babel/preset-env']
                }
            },
            {
                test: /\.css$/,
                use: [
                    MiniCssExtractPlugin.loader,
                    "css-loader"
                ]
            }
        ]
    },

    // https://webpack.js.org/concepts/plugins/
    plugins: [
        new CleanWebpackPlugin(buildPath),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: './src/index.html',
            inject: 'body',
            chunks: ['index'],
            filename: 'index.html'
        }),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: './src/about.html',
            inject: 'body',
            chunks: ['about'],
            filename: 'about.html'
        }),
        new HtmlWebpackPlugin({
            template: './src/contacts.html',
            inject: 'body',
            chunks: ['contacts'],
            filename: 'contacts.html'
        }),
        new MiniCssExtractPlugin({
            filename: "[name].[contenthash].css",
            chunkFilename: "[id].[contenthash].css"
        })
    ],

    // https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/
    optimization: {
        minimize: true,
        minimizer: [
            new TerserPlugin({
                cache: true,
                parallel: true,
                sourceMap: true
            }),
            new OptimizeCssAssetsPlugin({})
        ]
    }
};
```

Last step is to add handy commands to `package.json` to build and preview production assets in action:

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "webpack-dev-server --config webpack.dev.js --mode development",
  "build": "webpack --config webpack.prod.js --mode production",
  "preview": "npm run build && http-server dist"
},
```

To build and preview website locally run:

```bash
$ npm run preview
```
