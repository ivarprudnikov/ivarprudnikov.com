I was provided with an incredible opportunity to deliver my first-ever conference presentation at a security conference [BSides Dublin](https://www.bsidesdub.ie/) on May 27th. The event, known for its vibrant and inclusive atmosphere, welcomed security enthusiasts from various backgrounds. The organizers were truly exceptional, ensuring a seamless experience for both speakers and attendees alike.

With great excitement and a touch of nervous anticipation, I took the stage to share insights on a topic: "Signatures and Receipts in Supply Chain Security."

As I began, my enthusiasm got the better of me, causing me to speak at a rapid pace. In my eagerness to share my knowledge, I realized that I may have unintentionally rushed through some key points. Nevertheless, the supportive atmosphere created by the event's organizers and the understanding nature of the audience helped put me at ease.

BSides Dublin proved to be the perfect platform for my inaugural conference presentation!
